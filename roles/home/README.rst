What's This?
============

A very, very dirt simple ansible module for setting up my home environment on
Debian & RedHat systems. Installs a few packages, pulls down my dotfiles, and
I'm ready to go.

Usage
=====

In your site.yml or role list just include the module:


.. code:: yaml

    roles:
        - jkyle
